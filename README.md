## Why is data science (machine learning) important?

ML/DS can help us organize human activity more efficiently to get more results from less resources.

It lets us intelligently associate patterns to outcomes (supervised learning) and plan how to achieve desired results.

## Why is Linear Algebra useful for DS/ML?

Linear Algebra (along with probability and optimization) is the engine that powers ML to learn the mappings from patterns to outcomes.

## Solving simultaneous equations Quiz

Shown using numpy in python script file with a function that takes dictionary arguments.

## Dot Product

Depending on the field over the vector space and context, the dot product can be referred to as scalar product, scalar projection or inner product, which are all equivalent. 

### Modulus of Vector

The modulus or size of a vector x is denoted as ** | x | **. It is the square root of a vector dot product with itself.


### Cosine Rule

Scalar product has a relationship to scalar product.

## Vector Product

AKA Cross Product, Vector Projection and Directed Area Product

## Outer Product
