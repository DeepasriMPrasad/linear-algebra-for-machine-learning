## Why is data science (machine learning) important?

ML/DS can help us organize human activity more efficiently to get more results from less resources.

It lets us intelligently associate patterns to outcomes (supervised learning) and plan how to achieve desired results.

## Why is Linear Algebra useful for DS/ML?

Linear Algebra (along with probability and optimization) is the engine that powers ML to learn the mappings from patterns to outcomes.
